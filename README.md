## Project Overview

‘STEM Stars’ provide female mentor’s to female school, college and university students studying STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Mathematics) and females employed directly in a STEM role. 

Research shows that there are high attrition rates for females through STEM education and employment. This eventually leads to a gender imbalance in STEM workplaces and therefore leads to a lack of available female mentors which compounds the issue. Gender inequality has been linked to reduced workplace productivity, gender bias and reduced support for females in the workplace for promotion and opportunities.

‘STEM Stars’ offers Schools, universities and companies access to STEM female mentors from around the globe so that females can be supported through their education with a female role model right through into the workplace. Female retention rates are therefore increased and gender inequality in the workplace reduced, benefiting both female individuals within their chosen career paths and companies aiming to improve their diversity, inclusivity and productivity.

The project gives an overview of the services provided by ‘STEM Stars’, examples of mentors and a contact us form for accessing more information.

## Design

### Design Choices
The site will be visited by professionals from schools, colleges, universities and companies so the site is required to look professional, clear and concise. 

### Colour
Color mind was used to generate a palette of neutral colours for the site that are soft with a yellow that offers a distinctive contrast to add a splash off colour. This was to ensure that the site looks professional.

### Fonts
Google fonts has been imported and “Montserrat” has been used for all the text inside the website with sans-serif selected if a browser does not support the prior font.

### Structure
The page is structured in a user friendly, easily recognised, simple format. The first time user sees a typical navigation bar at the top of the page, with navigation links to the right. There is a footer at the bottom of the page containing the company name and links to social media sites.

The website consists of 5 separate pages: 
- A homepage consisting of a picture of females with computers with a text overlay and a button linking to the contact page. An about section giving an overview of STEM Stars. A section giving statistics regards females in STEM and issues with retention/attrition. A section to include 4 cards that each provide at a glance the services that STEM Stars offer. 
- A Mentor page with two cards showing an example of a female mentor from technology and a mentor from engineering. Each card has a button to a dedicated page which shows the individual mentors summary and bio. An embedded video explaining the benefits of mentors.
- A technology mentor page showing a picture, summary of the mentor and their bio.
- An Engineering mentor page showing a picture, summary of the mentor and their bio.
- A contact page with a contact form to ask for more information regards the service the site provides.

The final tech and engineer pages deviated slightly from the wireframes as the project was completed as changing the layout with 2 cards side by side seemed to look better overall on a large screen. The cards all line up vertically on smaller screens as this was the best fit for the screen width.
