# STEM Stars

## Project Overview

‘STEM Stars’ provide female mentor’s to female school, college and university students studying STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Mathematics) and females employed directly in a STEM role. 

Research shows that there are high attrition rates for females through STEM education and employment. This eventually leads to a gender imbalance in STEM workplaces and therefore leads to a lack of available female mentors which compounds the issue. Gender inequality has been linked to reduced workplace productivity, gender bias and reduced support for females in the workplace for promotion and opportunities.

‘STEM Stars’ offers Schools, universities and companies access to STEM female mentors from around the globe so that females can be supported through their education with a female role model right through into the workplace. Female retention rates are therefore increased and gender inequality in the workplace reduced, benefiting both female individuals within their chosen career paths and companies aiming to improve their diversity, inclusivity and productivity.

The project gives an overview of the services provided by ‘STEM Stars’, examples of mentors and a contact us form for accessing more information.
